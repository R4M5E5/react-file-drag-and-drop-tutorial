# React File Drag and Drop Tutorial Code

### What is this repository?

This repository contains the code for my **React File Drag and Drop** video tutorial. Please note that this code is not tested and may contain errors and therefore should not be used in a real app. The code is supposed to be used as a helper when coding along the video tutorial.

### Branches

This repository contains two branches.
The `start` branch contains the empty starter project with a basic React setup and some components to display images.

The `main` branch contains the implemented drag and drop component and is supposed to be used as a guide when coding along the video. If something is not working with your code you can compare it to the code in this branch.
